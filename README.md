Project title: MovingOut

Welcome to MovingOut! MovingOut is intended to offer all the advantages of a yardsale (quantity, speed and low-prices) to move items quickly, with the benefits of an application interface (no physical event and automating away much of the bartering and organizing aspects). A set-it-and-forget-it yardsale to empty my apartment in peace. 

Currently, a user can review the items available in a store, make an offer of either the price listed or a different price, see other offers currently made on that item, as well as update or delete their offers.  

In the future, when a buyer makes an offer of the price listed, that person will be auto-instructed with respect to how to proceed to pay and pick up the item. The item will be taken off the available items list. When an offer is made below the list price, the seller will be prompted to accept or reject the offer and the transaction will proceed accordingly.
